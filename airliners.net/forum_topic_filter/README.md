# [Topic Filter](https://github.com/MatthieuMichon/UserScripts/tree/master/airliners.net/forum_topic_filter/)

## Description

[Airliners.net forums](http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/) are a good source of information, but as like most boards on the net, the quality of some topics could be raised by ignoring authors lacking insight.

This user script attempts to achieve this goal by hiding posts written by authors with a RR (Respect Rating) below a given threshold.

## Compatibility

Works with the following browser / plugins combos:
* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) on [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop) desktop.
* [TamperMonkey](http://tampermonkey.net) on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) desktop.
Didn't try anything else.
